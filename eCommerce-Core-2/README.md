Goal
Solution is to be used as a reference for demoing patterns and practices
used by us at Don't Panic Labs.

.NET CORE Version
This version uses .NET Core 5, instead of the original .NET Framework used
by the first version we created.

SQL Server or Sqlite
This version supports two data stores, both SQL Server and Sqlite.

# Configuration - Handled through environment variables.

Visual Studio makes it easy to specify the environment variables per project.
You can do this on the property page for the project. You can also specify
environment variables through windows configuration. If you specify environment
variables through windows configuration you will need to restart Visual Studio
after setting the environment variables.

## Environment Variables Database

    Note, you can configure the database using the eCommerceDatabase environment
    variable or a the eCommerceDatabaseSqlite environment variable. If you do
    not specify either the system will run run. The eCommerceDatabase takes
    priority over eCommerceDatabaseSqlite.

## Mac Notes

    To set your environment variable on a Mac, you need to update your
    .bash_profile file. You will need to add an export line like below.
    export eCommerceDatabaseSqlite="Data Source=~/ecommerce.sqlite"

eCommerceDatabase: connection string for SQLExpress / SQLServer
Sample Value: "Server=.\SqlExpress; Database=DPLRef.eCommerce; Trusted_connection=true"

eCommerceDatabaseSqlite: connection string for Sqlite
Sample Value: Data Source=c:\temp\mydb.sqlite

eCommerceQueuePath local directory path used for async queuing
Sample Value: c:\temp\eCommerceQueuePath

Mini Assignment - If you want to dive in...

Want to do something inside of the reference implementation? There is an easy
assignment to get you started.

1. Get the reference implementation building and running.
2. Make sure all unit tests pass before you start.
3. In the 3rdParty folder there is a USATaxer library project that contains a very simple tax calculation library. Build this project. That will create a USATaxer.dll.
4. Copy that dll to the root of the eCommerce solution. Add a reference to it from the Accessors project.
5. Create a a new accessor SalesTaxRuleAccessor(ISalesTaxRuleAccessor)
6. Update the AccessorFactory to support the SalesTaxRuleAccessor service.
7. Write some unit tests for the new SalesTaxRuleAccessor service.
8. Edit the TaxCalculationEngine to use the new SalsTaxRuleAccessor service.
9. Some existing unit tests will break because sales tax values will change. Update those unit tests.
10. Profit :)
